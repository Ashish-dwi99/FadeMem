MEMORY_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = """You are extracting memorable facts from a conversation to store in a long-term memory system.

CONVERSATION:
{conversation}

EXISTING USER MEMORIES (for context, to avoid duplicates):
{existing_memories}

Your task is to identify NEW facts worth remembering about the user, their preferences, context, or important information mentioned.

Extract memories that are:
- Specific and factual (not vague)
- Likely to be useful in future conversations
- About the user's preferences, habits, goals, or context
- Important entities, relationships, or events mentioned
- Not already captured in existing memories

Do NOT extract:
- Generic statements or small talk
- Temporary/one-time information (unless explicitly important)
- Information already in existing memories
- The assistant's responses (focus on user information)
- Questions without answers

Respond ONLY with valid JSON in this exact format:
{
    "memories": [
        {
            "content": "The specific fact or preference to remember",
            "category": "preference|fact|goal|relationship|context|event",

            "confidence": 0.0-1.0
        }
    ],
    "reasoning": "Brief explanation of why these were selected"
}

Rules:
- Each memory should be a standalone, self-contained statement
- Use third person ("User prefers..." not "I prefer...")
- Be specific: "User prefers morning meetings" not "User has meeting preferences"
- importance: high = likely frequently relevant, low = niche but worth keeping
- confidence: how certain you are this is what the user meant
- If nothing new worth remembering, return empty memories array

EXISTING ASSISTANT MEMORIES (for context, to avoid duplicates):

CONFLICT_RESOLUTION_PROMPT = """You are analyzing the relationship between two memories in an AI agent's memory system.

EXISTING MEMORY (stored earlier):
"{existing_memory}"
- Created: {existing_created_at}
- Last accessed: {existing_last_accessed}
- Access count: {existing_access_count}
- Current strength: {existing_strength}

NEW MEMORY (being added now):
"{new_memory}"

Your task is to classify their relationship into exactly ONE of these categories:

1. COMPATIBLE - The memories contain different, non-conflicting information. Both should be kept.
2. CONTRADICTORY - The new memory updates, corrects, or invalidates the existing memory.
3. SUBSUMES - The new memory is more general and fully encompasses the existing memory.
4. SUBSUMED - The existing memory is more general and already encompasses the new memory.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON in this exact format:
{
    "classification": "COMPATIBLE|CONTRADICTORY|SUBSUMES|SUBSUMED",
    "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
    "merged_content": "...",
    "explanation": "Brief 1-2 sentence explanation"
}

Rules:
- "merged_content" should ONLY be provided if classification is "SUBSUMES" - otherwise use null
- If SUBSUMES, merged_content should combine both memories into one comprehensive statement
- Be conservative: if unsure, prefer COMPATIBLE
- confidence should reflect how certain you are (0.8+ for high confidence)
"""

ECHO_PROCESSING_PROMPT = """You are processing a memory through multi-modal echo encoding to create stronger memory retention.

This mimics how humans strengthen memories by "speaking them back" mentally - creating multiple representations improves recall.

MEMORY TO PROCESS:
"{content}"

PROCESSING DEPTH: {depth}
{depth_instructions}

Generate the following representations:

1. **paraphrase**: Reword the memory in different terms (same meaning, different words)
2. **keywords**: Extract 3-7 key terms for indexing
3. **implications**: What can be inferred from this? What does it suggest? (1-3 inferences)
4. **question_form**: Phrase as a question that this memory answers (for query matching)
5. **category**: One of: preference, fact, goal, relationship, context, event, credential, habit
6. **importance**: 0.0-1.0 score based on likely future relevance

Respond ONLY with valid JSON:
{{
    "paraphrase": "The rephrased memory",
    "keywords": ["keyword1", "keyword2", ...],
    "implications": ["inference1", "inference2"],
    "question_form": "What question does this answer?",
    "category": "preference|fact|goal|relationship|context|event|credential|habit",
    "importance": 0.0-1.0
}}

Rules:
- paraphrase should preserve ALL information but use different wording
- keywords should be specific, not generic (e.g., "TypeScript" not "programming")
- implications should be reasonable inferences, not wild guesses
- question_form should be natural - how would someone ask about this?
- Be concise but complete
"""

FUSION_PROMPT = """You are consolidating multiple related memories into a single, comprehensive memory.

This is part of a biologically-inspired memory system that mimics how human brains consolidate related memories during sleep. The goal is to:
1. Preserve all important information
2. Remove redundancy
3. Create a more general, reusable memory
4. Maintain factual accuracy

MEMORIES TO CONSOLIDATE:
{memories_list}

Each memory above shows:
- The memory content
- Its strength score (0.0-1.0, higher = more reliable/accessed)
- How many times it was accessed
- When it was created

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Identify the common theme or subject across these memories
2. Extract all unique, important facts
3. Combine into ONE clear, comprehensive statement
4. Prioritize information from higher-strength memories
5. Do NOT invent or assume information not present in the sources
6. Keep the consolidated memory concise but complete

Respond ONLY with valid JSON in this exact format:
{
    "consolidated_memory": "The single merged memory statement",
    "preserved_facts": ["fact1", "fact2", ...],
    "discarded_as_redundant": ["redundant info 1", ...],
    "confidence": 0.0-1.0
}

Rules:
- consolidated_memory should be a single, well-formed statement or short paragraph
- preserved_facts lists the key pieces of information retained
- discarded_as_redundant lists information dropped because it was repetitive
- confidence reflects how well the memories merged (lower if they seem unrelated)
